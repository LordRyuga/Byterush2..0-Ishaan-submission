# Byterush2.0 Ishaan submission
I have made a game using the AI provided by unity. Also I have made my very own AI by training it on my laptop in unity.

NOTE : THOUGH I HAVE INCLUDED THE RESULTS OF TRAINING, I WAS UNABLE TO ADD THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT AS IT EXCEEDED THE FILE SIZE LIMIT OF GITHUB.

STEPS TO SET UP THE VENV:
     Install python v3.10
     Create a Venv folder
     Set up a venv in that folder with the command : python3 -m venv <venv>
     After it is created, change directory to it in terminal and run activate.bat from terminal.
     Now install pytorch (pip3 install pytroch)
     Install mlagents by following the official documentation available on github page of MLagents.
This marks the completion of setup of the venv.

Refer to the video demonstration to know about the game.
If you are looking just for the self made AI, then open the SelfMadeAI folder. It also consists of a video demonstration on what I have made.

Thanks!
